# Air_Quality_Prediction
This is a basic problem of Machine Learning using the Linear Regression algorithm.

The problem statement is that a training dataset is given which comprises of 5 features which affect Air Quality Index(AQI) and the 
corresponding AQI.
Based on this training dataset, we have to predict the AQI based on the 5 input features.

Linear Regression is a technique to generate the best fit line according to the dataset and predict according to that line. This line
may have any number of dimensions ( 5 Dimensional in this case ).
This simple project is an important application of this technique and gives very good results when the data is nearly linear in nature.
